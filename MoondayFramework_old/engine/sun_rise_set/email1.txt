Hi Robert...

ok, first, the main sunrise/sunset calculation class is in sun.php... then, make sure that math.php is in the same folder as sun.php. (basically, sun.php does a "require_once" on math.php). the math.php file contains simple math functions to get sine, cosine, tangent, arctangent, arcsine, arccosine, etc... by passing the angle in "degrees" (0-360) instead of radians...

then, all you have to do is, in your client program just "require_once" or "include_once" sun.php, then you instantiate a sun object like so:

$sun=new sun;

then, you can find out the sunset or sunrise of any day by passing the correct parameters to the methods... I may have forgotten to include the argument list.. :( sorry.. anyways, here it is..

$sun->rise(date,timezone,latitude,longitude,zenith);
$sun->set(date,timezone,latitude,longitude,zenith);

where:
date = date for which you want the sunrise/sunset

timezone = timezone in hours... west is negative, east is positive... usually ranges from -12 to +12... if you want rise/set in GMT or UTC time, just use 0

latitude,longitude = coordinates of the location for which you want to calculate sunrise/sunset

zenith = YOUR definition of sunrise/sunset (what angle the sun needs to be, so that you say it is rising or setting)... 0 degrees means the sun is directly over head. 90 degrees means the sun is exactly at the horizon. usually there are 4 "definitions" of sunrise/set... "official", "civil", "nautical", and "astronomical"... for a nice explanation, visit this site.. http://www.word-detective.com/howcome/stilllight.html

hope this helped.... if you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask... :) .. if you don't mind, i can upload this email to the site, so that others can also be helped if they're having problems with the class...

-best regards...
